        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            "Inception" is a mind-bending science fiction thriller directed by Christopher Nolan. The film follows Dom Cobb (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), a skilled thief who specializes in entering people's dreams to steal their secrets. He is hired for a dangerous mission: to plant an idea into someone's mind rather than steal one.
